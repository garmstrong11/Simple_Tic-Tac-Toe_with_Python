This is the *Simple Tic-Tac-Toe with Python* project I made myself.


<p>Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Letâ€™s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!</p>
